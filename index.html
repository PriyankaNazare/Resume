                                    The Strategic Cash Collateral Management (CCM) initiative aims to standardize and

                                    It mitigates the client risk. The CCM application receives the intraday real time 
                                    balances from the Future Balance service and generate the auto suggested 
                                    movements (booking/margin call) for arrangements. Also user can create the manual 
                                    booking for the day and will send it for further processing. Based on the action will 
                                    send it to third party system PTM for settlement.
